# Tap-N-Pop
TapNPop is an interactive, webcam-based game that challenges your hand-eye coordination! Using MediaPipe for advanced hand tracking, you control an on-screen pointer with your index finger. The objective is to "pop" the green target circle by touching it with your index finger tip to score points. The game runs for a fixed 30-second duration, after which your final score is displayed.
